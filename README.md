PI in the Sky Project

## Planning 

### The Idea
The basic idea is to attach the Pi to the end of an arrow and shoot it off a bow. There will be a capsule at the end of the arrow containing the Pi and all other related components. We estimate that in comparison to other projects we've done in the past this one shouldn't take as much time because the approach to it is much simpler. 

### Schedule 

week1- Planning and finish plannng

week2- At the beginning get the plan approved by Dr.Shields. 

weeks 2-4: Finish cad and coding 

week5- printing 

week 6-7: Assembling/wiring, mounting parts inside of capsule

week 8-9: Troubleshooting/testing

### Potential problems
Problems that we could potentially encounter throughout this project could include a complication with the parachute persay. We plan on having a parachute pop out at the end of the capsule in attempt to slow down the landing of the Pi and avoid breaking it. It might be difficult to time the capsule perfectly to release a parachute as it begins falling down but that is just one of the challenges we will have to figure out.  More problems that we could encounter could be with the capsule. For instance, the capsule could provide way too much air resistance which would cause the arrow to slow down and fail to reach it's full potential for velocity. Another problem that could come with the capsule could be that it might end up being too heavy therefor causing it to slow down or not shoot as well. There is a posibility that the capsule may also end up being too frail, which would cause it to break once it lands.
